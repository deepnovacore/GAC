## 💡 What is GAC?

Hybrid SFT–RL post-training is the standard recipe for aligning LLMs — but the *mixing weight* **μ** between the two signals is almost always a **fixed, hand-tuned schedule**. This is fragile: when RL noise spikes, or when the SFT expert starts pulling the policy in a wrong direction, a static μ over-commits to whichever side is currently *less* reliable.

**GAC solves this by treating μ as an estimation problem.**

We derive a closed-form optimal μ that minimizes the MSE of the composite gradient under a signal-vs-noise decomposition:

<div align="center">

**μ\* = ( α<sub>tgt</sub>·Δg² + σ<sub>r</sub>² ) / ( Δg² + σ<sub>s</sub>² + σ<sub>r</sub>² )**

</div>

where **σ<sub>s</sub>², σ<sub>r</sub>²** are SFT and RL noise variances and **Δg²** is the SFT–RL disagreement. Since gradient-level quantities are prohibitively expensive at every step, we deploy three **coefficient-space proxies** estimated online from tensors any GRPO/PPO trainer already computes, wrapped in EMA smoothing, a cosine-schedule prior, and per-step change capping.

**Paper result**: **+3.8 pp over HPT** (the previous best hybrid post-training method) averaged over math, code, science, and logic benchmarks, with **< 1% wall-time overhead**, **28% lower KL-drift area**, and gains that **grow with model scale** from 1.5B → 14B.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

- 🎯 **Closed-form μ\***, derived from MSE-optimal gradient estimation — no meta-learning, no bilevel optimization, no extra hyperparameter grid.
- 📉 **Coefficient-space proxies**: three cheap signals (`σ_s²`, `σ_r²`, `Δg̃²`) that any PPO/GRPO trainer already has on hand.
- 🛡️ **Guarded controller stack**: EMA smoothing → cosine-prior blend → per-step change cap → hard clipping. Robust to mid-training regime shifts.
- ⚡ **< 1% wall-time overhead**: proxies are computed inside the existing forward pass, no extra network eval.
- 📈 **Consistent gains across scales**: **+2.2 pp @ 1.5B**, **+3.8 pp @ 7B**, **+3.3 pp @ 14B** on AMC vs. HPT (paper Table 3).
- 🔬 **Length-invariant by construction**: each sequence contributes exactly one scalar per proxy, so longer rollouts don't get extra vote weight.

## 📊 Results

### Qwen3.5-4B compact release

To keep GAC aligned with progress in capable compact models, we retrained the
method on **Qwen3.5-4B** and release the resulting checkpoint for research and
evaluation. The table compares the Qwen3.5-4B base checkpoint with the GAC
release under a fixed single-snapshot protocol.

| Domain | Benchmark | Eval size (N) | Qwen3.5-4B Base | GAC-Qwen3.5-4B |
|:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| Mathematics | AMC | 83 | 19.3% | **67.5%** |
| Mathematics | AIME24 | 30 | 0.0% | **26.7%** |
| Mathematics | AIME25 | 30 | 3.3% | **20.0%** |
| Knowledge | MMLU-Pro | 1,000 | 58.3% | **74.2%** |
| Science | GPQA-Diamond | 198 | 29.3% | **64.1%** |
| Science | SciBench | 692 | 11.4% | **60.1%** |
| Code | MBPP | 500 | 67.6% | **74.6%** |
| Code | HumanEval | 164 | 67.7% | **81.1%** |
| Logic | BBH Logical Deduction | 750 | 86.3% | **93.1%** |
| Logic | BBH Object Counting | 250 | 93.2% | **92.8%** |
| Logic | BBH Tracking | 750 | 97.6% | **95.3%** |
| Logic | BBH average (macro) | 3 slices / 1,750 | 92.4% | **93.7%** |

The GAC release is higher on 9 of 11 task slices in this snapshot, with gains
across mathematics, knowledge, science, and code. These are release metrics;
use the public evaluator for exact per-example counts and reruns.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepnovacore/GAC.git
cd GAC
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

The controller has **no framework-specific dependencies** beyond PyTorch. `torch.distributed` is used only if you have multi-GPU.

### Minimal integration (5 lines)

Drop the controller into any hybrid SFT–RL loop:

```python
from gac import AdaptiveMuController
from gac.sft_loss import SFTPhiLossFn
from gac.hybrid_loss import compute_hybrid_loss
from gac.controller import mu_schedule

controller = AdaptiveMuController(
    ema_beta=0.99,
    mu_change_cap=0.01,
    trim_ratio_sft=0.10,
    mu_update_freq=10,
    alpha_static=0.5,
)
sft_loss_fn = SFTPhiLossFn(token_level=True)

def training_step(batch, global_step, rl_loss_fn):
    # cosine-schedule prior on μ (peak → valley over training)
    prior = mu_schedule(
        global_step,
        warmup_steps=200, decay_steps=800,
        mu_peak=0.85, mu_valley=0.15,
    )
    # μ is inferred inside compute_hybrid_loss via the controller
    loss, logs = compute_hybrid_loss(
        logprob=batch["logprob"],
        action_mask=batch["action_mask"],
        advantages=batch["advantages"],
        expert_mask=batch["expert_mask"],
        rl_loss_fn=rl_loss_fn,          # your favorite PPO / GRPO surrogate
        sft_loss_fn=sft_loss_fn,
        controller=controller,
        global_step=global_step,
        schedule_prior=prior,
        blend_weight=0.5,               # λ in the paper — cosine-prior blend
    )
    return loss, logs
```

That's it. GAC only touches the **weighting between** the SFT and RL losses; it does not modify either loss itself. You keep your PPO / GRPO implementation, your RL infrastructure, and your reward model unchanged.

## 🔍 Evaluation & Release

The public [`eval/`](eval/) harness covers **11 task slices across 9 dataset
families**: AMC, AIME24, AIME25, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, SciBench, MBPP,
HumanEval, and three BBH logic subsets. It includes dataset provenance,
fixed-subset validation, aggregation, and isolated code scoring.

```bash
cd eval
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash run_all.sh --model_path /path/to/your-checkpoint \
  --output_dir ./results --tp_size 4
```

MMLU-Pro uses a pinned revision and a checked-in 1,000-ID manifest. GPQA is a
gated dataset: authenticate with Hugging Face or provide a complete, lawfully
obtained CSV through `--gpqa_csv`. See [`eval/README.md`](eval/README.md) for
benchmark commands, scoring details, Slurm usage, and the code-execution
safety boundary.

The [GAC-Qwen3.5-4B checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/YueLinHu/GAC-Qwen3.5-4B)
contains the compact-backbone release and its evaluation protocol. The
original paper's experimental tables remain available in the
[OpenReview paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VhBpT4iq60).

## 📐 Method

The controller performs three operations per update:

**1. Proxy estimation** *(Sec. 3.2 of the paper)*

| Symbol | Meaning | Length-invariant? |
|---|---|:---:|
| σ<sub>r</sub>² | Variance of *sequence-level* GRPO-normalized advantages across the batch. **Post-normalization dispersion**, not raw reward variance. | ✅ |
| σ<sub>s</sub>² | Tail-trimmed variance of length-normalized per-sequence NLL on expert samples. | ✅ |
| Δg̃² | Mean squared coefficient mismatch between SFT and RL token-level gradient coefficients on shared response tokens, after within-batch z-normalization. | ✅ |

**2. Closed-form aggregation** into μ\*:

<div align="center">

μ\* = ( α<sub>tgt</sub>·Δg̃² + σ<sub>r</sub>² ) / ( Δg̃² + σ<sub>s</sub>² + σ<sub>r</sub>² )

</div>

**3. Guarded update**:

```
raw_μ*  →  EMA(β)  →  blend(λ) with cosine prior  →  clip |Δμ| ≤ c̄  →  clip to [μ_min, μ_max]
```

Detailed derivation (including the MSE minimization, the proxy-vs-oracle validation, and length-invariance proofs) is in **[docs/method.md](docs/method.md)** and Appendices A–D of the paper.
